# JAD—Just Another Demonstrator

JAD is a demonstrator that deploys a fully-fledged dataspace as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution in Kubernetes.
This is to illustrate how Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) can deploy and manage dataspace components in their own cloud
infrastructure.

For that, JAD uses the "Virtual Connector" project: <https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Virtual-Connector>

## Components

Such a dataspace requires – at a minimum – the following components:

- a control plane: handles protocol messages and catalog data for each participant
- IdentityHub: responsible for managing Verifiable Credentials (presentation and storage)
- IssuerService: issues Verifiable Credentials to participants' IdentityHubs
- a data plane: performs the actual data transfer
- an identity provider: handles API authentication of management APIs. We are using Keycloak here.
- a vault: used to securely store sensitive data, such as the private keys etc. We are using Hashicorp Vault.
- a database server: contains persistent data of all the components. We are using PostgreSQL.
- a messaging system: used to process asynchronous messages. We are using NATS for this.
- a connector fabric manager (CFM): comprised of the `tenant-manager` and the `provision-manager` as well as several
  agents to manage dataspace participant resources

## Required tools and apps

- KinD: a basic Kubernetes runtime inside a single Docker container.
- Java 17+
- Docker
- `kubectl`
- Helm (for Traefik installation)
- macOS or Linux as an operating system. **Windows is not natively supported**!
- a POSIX-compliant shell (e.g., bash, zsh)
- [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com) (or similar). The API requests here are optimized for Bruno, but other tools work as
  well. Bruno does offer a CLI client, but that does not handle token refresh automatically, so we'll use the GUI.
- [optional]: a Kubernetes monitoring tool like K9S, Lens, Headlamp, etc. Not required, but certainly helpful.

_All shell commands are executed from the root of the project unless stated otherwise._

## Getting started

### 1. Create a KinD cluster

To create a KinD cluster, run:

```shell
cp ~/.kube/config ~/.kube/config.bak # to save your existing kubeconfig
kind create cluster -n edcv --kubeconfig ~/.kube/edcv-kind.conf
ln -sf ~/.kube/edcv-kind.conf ~/.kube/config # to use KinD's kubeconfig
```

Next, we need to deploy a Gateway controller to allow access to services from outside the cluster. There are several
popular choices, and we've opted for [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/setup/kubernetes/) in this case. We could
have gone for Envoy, but Traefik is easier to set up and lighter-weight.

```shell
helm repo add traefik https://traefik.github.io/charts
helm repo update
helm upgrade --install --namespace traefik traefik traefik/traefik --create-namespace -f values.yaml
```

Then, install the custom resource definitions (CRDs) for the Gateway API:

```shell
kubectl apply --server-side --force-conflicts -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.4.1/experimental-install.yaml
```

#### Enable network access to services

With the Gateway API, there are three main ways to access services from outside the cluster:

- using port-forwarding: this is a manual way to forward ports from the host to the cluster. This is not
  recommended for production use but works fine for local testing. We will use this approach here for simplicity.

- via a LoadBalancer service: this is typically used in cloud-hosted Kubernetes clusters, where the cloud provider
  provisions a load balancer automatically. This is the recommended approach for production use when running in
  cloud-hosted environments, and DNS names are used. For KinD, there is no built-in load balancer, but one can be
  installed

- via `NodePort` services: this exposes services on high-numbered ports on the host machine. This is not
  recommended for production use, and it gets complicated quickly when multiple services are involved, as is the case
  here. _This is not shown here_.

##### Option 1 (recommended): via port-forwarding

To set up port-forwarding, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl -n traefik port-forward svc/traefik 80
```

This forwards port 80 from the host to the Traefik service inside the cluster. You may need to run this with `sudo`
privileges on some systems.

##### Option 2: via LoadBalancer (alternative)

The KinD project provides
a [cloud-like load balancer implementation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cloud-provider-kind). It emulates an
external LB as you would get on cloud-hosted K8s clusters.
Install it according to the instructions in the repository.

Verify, that the `EXTERNAL-IP` of the `traefik` service is not yet assigned:

```shell
kubectl get svc -n traefik
NAME      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
traefik   LoadBalancer   10.96.251.221   <pending>     80:31415/TCP,443:31650/TCP   22s
```

To assign an IP address to the Traefik LoadBalancer service, we need to run the external LB:

```shell
cloud-provider-kind
# on macOS:
sudo cloud-provider-kind
```

Now, if we rerun the previous command, we should see a similar output to this:

```shell
kubectl get svc -n traefik
NAME      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
traefik   LoadBalancer   10.96.251.221   172.18.0.3    80:31415/TCP,443:31650/TCP   2m31s
```

> Note that with the external LB, services inside the cluster must be accessed via the external IP address, e.g.
> `172.18.0.3` in this case. Variables inside the Bruno collection must be adjusted accordingly!

### 2. Deploy applications

#### 2.1 Option 1: Use pre-built images

There are pre-built images for all JAD apps available from [GHCR](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspace-hub/jad/packages) and the
Connector Fabric Manager images are available from
the [CFM GitHub Repository](https://github.com/eclipse-cfm/cfm/packages). Those are tested and we
strongly recommend using them.

#### 2.2 Option 2: Build images from source

However, for the adventurous among us who want to build them from source, for example, because they've modified the code
and now want to see it in action, please follow the following steps to build and load JAD apps:

- build Docker images:

  ```shell
  ./gradlew dockerize
  ```

  This will build the Docker images for all components and store them in the local Docker registry.

- load images into KinD: KinD has no access to the host's docker context, so we need to load the images into KinD. Note
  that other Kubernetes runtimes such as Minikube do things differently. Verify that all images are there by running
  `docker images`. Then run:

  ```shell
  kind load docker-image \
      ghcr.io/eclipse-dataspace-hub/jad/controlplane:latest \
      ghcr.io/eclipse-dataspace-hub/jad/identity-hub:latest \
      ghcr.io/eclipse-dataspace-hub/jad/issuerservice:latest \
      ghcr.io/eclipse-dataspace-hub/jad/dataplane:latest -n edcv
  ```

  or if you're a bash God:

  ```shell
  kind load docker-image -n edcv $(docker images --format "{{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}" | grep '^ghcr.io/eclipse-dataspace-hub/jad.*:latest')
  ```

- build CFM docker images locally:

  ```shell
  cd /path/to/cfm/
  make load-into-kind
  ```

  This builds all CFM components' docker images and loads them into your KinD cluster, assuming that your KinD cluster
  is named `"edcv"`. If not, set the cluster name for the make file accordingly:

  ```
  cd /path/to/cfm/
  make load-into-kind KIND_CLUSTER_NAME=your_cluster_name`.
  ```

  Note that individual `make` targets for all CFM components exist, for example `make load-into-kind-pmanager`.

- modify the deployment manifests of the components you want to load locally by setting the `imagePullPolicy: Never`
  which forces KinD to rely on local images rather than pulling them. This can be done with search-and-replace from your
  favorite editor, or you can do it from the command line by running

  ```shell
  sed -i "s/imagePullPolicy:.*Always/imagePullPolicy: Never/g" <FILENAME>
  ```

  **CAUTION Mac users**: this requires GNU-sed. By default, macOS, has a special version of `sed` so you will have
  to [install GNU sed first](https://medium.com/@bramblexu/install-gnu-sed-on-mac-os-and-set-it-as-default-7c17ef1b8f64)

- For the EDC-V components, the relevant files are `controlplane.yaml`, `dataplane.yaml`, `identityhub.yaml` and
  `issuerservice.yaml`
- as a simplification, and to modify the image pull policy of both EDC-V _and_ CFM components, run:

  ```shell
  grep -rlZ "imagePullPolicy: Always" k8s/apps  | xargs sed -i "s/imagePullPolicy:.*Always/imagePullPolicy: Never/g"
  ```

  For this, both the EDC-V and CFM docker images must be built locally!!

#### 2.3 Build and deploy clearglass

Clearglass is a small Rust application that acts as a reverse proxy for the JAD services and is described in more
detail in a [later chapter](#jads-apis--a-single-pane-of-glass). It is being deployed as part of the base (or
infrastructure)
layer.

For now, we have to build and load it manually using the following commands:

Clearglass is available in the CFM project: https://github.com/eclipse-cfm/clearglass.

### 3. Deploy the services

JAD uses plain Kubernetes manifests to deploy the services. All the manifests are located in the [k8s](./k8s) folder.
While it is possible to just use the Kustomize plugin and running `kubectl apply -k k8s/`, you may experience nasty race
conditions because some services depend on others to be fully operational before they can start properly.

The recommended way is to deploy infrastructure services first, and application services second. This can be done
by running:

```shell
kubectl apply -k k8s/base/

# Wait for the infrastructure services to be ready:
kubectl wait --namespace edc-v \
            --for=condition=ready pod \
            --selector=type=edcv-infra \
            --timeout=90s

kubectl apply -k k8s/apps/

# Wait for seed jobs to be ready:
kubectl wait --namespace edc-v \
            --for=condition=complete job --all \
            --timeout=90s
```

Here's a copy-and-pasteable command to delete and redeploy everything:

```shell
kubectl delete -k k8s/; \
kubectl apply -k k8s/base && \
kubectl wait --namespace edc-v \
            --for=condition=ready pod \
            --selector=type=edcv-infra \
            --timeout=90s && \
kubectl apply -k k8s/apps && \
kubectl wait --namespace edc-v \
            --for=condition=complete job --all \
            --timeout=90s
```

_Note: the `";"` after `kubectl delete -k k8s/` is on purpose for robustness, to allow the command to fail if no
resources are deployed yet._

This deploys all the services in the correct order. The services are deployed in the `edc-v` namespace. Please verify
that everything got deployed correctly by running `kubectl get deployments -n edc-v`. This should output something like:

```text
NAME            READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE             AGE
cfm-agents                1/1     1            1           117m
cfm-provision-manager     1/1     1            1           117m
cfm-tenant-manager        1/1     1            1           117m
controlplane              1/1     1            1           117m
dataplane                 1/1     1            1           117m
identityhub               1/1     1            1           117m
issuerservice             1/1     1            1           117m
keycloak                  1/1     1            1           110m
nats                      1/1     1            1           110m
postgres                  1/1     1            1           110m
vault                     1/1     1            1           110m
```

### 4. Inspect your deployment

- database: the PostgreSQL database is accessible from outside the cluster via
  `jdbc:postgresql://postgres.localhost/controlplane`, username `cp`, password `cp`.
- vault: the vault is accessible from outside the cluster via `http://vault.localhost`, using token `root`.
- keycloak: access `http://keycloak.localhost/` and use username `admin` and password `admin`

**Caution: these are security-relevant credentials and must not be used in production! EVER!!**

In addition, you should see the following Kubernetes jobs (`kubectl get jobs -n edc-v`) running:

```text
NAME                       STATUS     COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
issuerservice-seed         Complete   1/1           13s        119m
provision-manager-seed     Complete   1/1           15s        119m
vault-bootstrap            Complete   1/1           19s        120m
```

Those are needed to populate the databases and the vault with initial data.

### 5. Prepare the data space

In addition to the initial seed data, a few bits and pieces are required for it to become fully operational. These can
be put in place by running the REST requests in the `CFM - Provision Consumer` folder and in the
`CFM - Provision Provider`
in the [Bruno collection](./requests/EDC-V%20Onboarding). Be sure to select the `"KinD Local"` environment in
Bruno.

![bruno.png](docs/images/bruno.png)

Those requests can be run manually, one after the other, or via Bruno's "Run" feature. It may be necessary to manually
refresh the access token in the `"Auth*"` tab.

This creates a consumer and a provider participant using the Connector Fabric Manager's (CFM) REST API. CFM does a lot
of the heavy lifting by doing the following:

- creates access credentials for both the Vault and the Administration APIs
- creates a `ParticipantContext` in the control plane
- creates a `ParticipantContext` in IdentityHub
- registers the new `ParticipantContext` with the IssuerService
- requests VerifiableCredentials from the IssuerService

N.B.: the `Get Participant Profile` may need to be run repeatedly until all entries in the `vpas` array have a
`"state": "active"` field. This is because the deployment is an asynchronous process and all agents need to run before
the profile is activated.

## Seeding EDC-V CEL Expressions

For evaluating policies EDC-V makes usage of the CEL (Common Expression Language) engine. To demonstrate this, we
will create a simple CEL expression that allows data access only to participants that possess a valid Membership
Credential.

Run the requests in the `Create CEL expression` request in folder `EDC-V Management/Prepare consumer participant` in the
same Bruno collection to create the CEL expression in the ControlPlane.

![img.png](docs/images/bruno_cel_expr.png)

## Seeding the Provider

Before we can transfer data, we need to seed the Provider with an asset, a policy and a contract definition. This is
done by running the requests in the `EDC-V Management/Provider` folder in the same Bruno collection. Again, make sure
to select the
`"KinD Local"` environment.

![img.png](docs/images/bruno_provider_seed.png)

**If all requests ran successfully, you should now have access credentials for both the consumer and the provider!**

## Transfer Data

Now that both participants are set up, we can transfer data from the Provider to the Consumer.
The only use case supported here:

- Certificates sharing via HTTP

### Certificates sharing via HTTP

The second use case demonstrates how certificates can be shared between participants using EDC-V's HTTP data
transfer capabilities.

First we need to upload a certificate to the Provider. This is done by running the
`Data Transfer/Http Certs/Provider/Upload Certificate` request in Bruno:

![img.png](docs/images/bruno_upload_certificate.png)

by selecting a file to upload (e.g. a `.pdf` file). Additional metadata can be provided in the request body using
the `metadata` field.

Then perform the entire sequence by running both requests in the `Data Transfer/Http Certs/Consumer` folder in Bruno:

![img.png](docs/images/bruno_certificate_consumer.png)

which:

- Fetches the catalog from the Provider storing the offer id for the certificate asset
- Setup the Contract negotiation using the offer id
- Poll the Contract Negotiation for the agreement id if the negotiation is successful
- Setup the transfer request for the agreement id of the previous step
- Fetch the access token for the transfer request (Siglet)
- Query the provider for listing the available certificates storing the first certificate id
- Finally, download the certificate using the certificate id

## Automated tests

JAD comes with a set of automated tests that can be run against the deployed services. These tests are located in the
[tests/end2end](./tests/end2end) folder. To run them, deploy JAD without creating any resources, and then run the test
suite:

```shell
./gradlew test -DincludeTags="EndToEndTest"
```

This may be particularly useful if you want to tinker with the code base, add or change stuff and would like to see if
everything still works. Remember to rebuild and reload the docker images, though...

## Cleanup

To remove the deployment, run:

```shell
kubectl delete -k k8s/
```

## Troubleshooting

In case any errors occur referring to authentication or authorization, it is recommended to delete and re-deploy the
entire base and all apps.

For example, if a participant onboarding went only through half-way, we recommend to do a clean-slate redeployment.

In some cases, even deleting and re-creating the KinD cluster may be required.

## JAD's APIs: GlassAPI - A single pane of glass

All JAD services are exposed through a single Traefik gateway (`edcv-gateway`) on `jad.localhost`, acting as a single
pane of glass. Each service is reachable via a path prefix rewritten before forwarding to the backend.

This single pane of glass is called the `GlassAPI`. and is protected by an auth backend called `clearglass`, details
are [here](#clearglass).

Authentication is enforced at the gateway level using Traefik `ForwardAuth` middlewares. Each middleware forwards the
`Authorization` header to the `clearglass` service, which validates the Bearer token against Keycloak via RFC 7662
token introspection and checks for the required OAuth2 scopes. Services without a `middleware` entry listed are
unauthenticated at the gateway level.

### Application routes (`jad.localhost`)

| Service             | Exposed path        | Rewrites to             | Backend port | Auth middleware                        |
|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| Control Plane       | `/api/management`   | `/api/mgmt`             | `8081`       | `jwt-auth-management-api`              |
| Identity Hub        | `/api/identity`     | `/api/identity/v1alpha` | `7081`       | `jwt-auth-identity-api`                |
| Issuer Service      | `/api/issuer/admin` | `/api/admin/v1alpha`    | `10013`      | `jwt-auth-issuer-admin-api`            |
| Provision Manager   | `/api/pm`           | `/api/v1alpha`          | `8080`       | `jwt-auth-provision-manager-api`       |
| Tenant Manager      | `/api/tm`           | `/api/v1alpha1`         | `8080`       | `jwt-auth-tenant-manager-api`          |
| Dataplane (public)  | `/api/dp/public`    | `/`                     | `11002`      | —                                      |
| Dataplane (control) | `/api/dp/control`   | `/`                     | `8083`       | —                                      |
| Dataplane (certs)   | `/api/dp/certs`     | `/`                     | `8186`       | —                                      |
| Siglet              | `/api/siglet`       | `/`                     | `8080`       | —                                      |
| Redline             | `/redline`          | `/`                     | `8081`       | —                                      |
| Keycloak            | `/auth`             | `/`                     | `8080`       | — (is the auth server)                 |
| Web UI              | `/ui`               | `/`                     | `80`         | — (obtains its own token via Keycloak) |

### Auth middleware scopes

Each `jwt-auth-*` middleware enforces a specific pair of OAuth2 scopes (`read` and `write`):

| Middleware                       | Required scopes                                             |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `jwt-auth-management-api`        | `management-api:read`, `management-api:write`               |
| `jwt-auth-identity-api`          | `identity-api:read`, `identity-api:write`                   |
| `jwt-auth-issuer-admin-api`      | `issuer-admin-api:read`, `issuer-admin-api:write`           |
| `jwt-auth-provision-manager-api` | `provision-manager-api:read`, `provision-manager-api:write` |
| `jwt-auth-tenant-manager-api`    | `tenant-manager-api:read`, `tenant-manager-api:write`       |

### Infrastructure routes (each on their own hostname)

Infrastructure services are not protected by the auth middleware and are only intended for local development access.

| Service    | Hostname               | Remark                                                         |
|------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Grafana    | `grafana.localhost`    |                                                                |
| Prometheus | `prometheus.localhost` |                                                                |
| Jaeger     | `jaeger.localhost`     |                                                                |
| Loki       | `loki.localhost`       |                                                                |
| Vault      | `vault.localhost`      | access from outside the cluster is only intended for e2e tests |

### Clearglass

`clearglass` is a small sidecar service (`ghcr.io/eclipse-cfm/clearglass`) that acts as the authentication and
authorization enforcement point for all protected APIs. Traefik's `ForwardAuth` mechanism intercepts every inbound
request and calls `clearglass`'s `/validate` endpoint before forwarding it to the backend.

The proxy performs two checks:

1. **Token validation** — it calls Keycloak's RFC 7662 token introspection endpoint
   (`/realms/edcv/protocol/openid-connect/token/introspect`) using its own client credentials (`clearglass` /
   `clearglass-secret`) to verify that the Bearer token in the `Authorization` header is active.
2. **Scope check** — the required OAuth2 scopes are passed as `?scope=` query parameters by each Traefik middleware.
   The proxy checks that the token carries at least those scopes. If either check fails, the request is rejected with
   `401 Unauthorized` before it ever reaches the backend service.

This design keeps authentication logic out of the individual services and centralizes it in one place, making it easy
to add or modify access rules by updating the middleware definitions in
[`k8s/base/jwt-middleware.yaml`](k8s/base/jwt-middleware.yaml).

## Advanced topics

### Rotate a participant's key material

Keys should be rotated periodically to reduce the chance of all sorts of nasty attacks such as Lattice attacks or
side-channel attacks. In practical applications, this would be done by a management application that uses the Glass
API, like an admin dashboard, that periodically invokes these APIs here to perform the action.

Participant keys are managed by IdentityHub and stored in a secure vault.

Rotating keys is not a single operation; rather, several individual steps are performed in IdentityHub, such as deleting
the old private key, updating the DID document, etc. However, all of this is abstracted by a single API call.

The general sequence of operations necessary to collect the required information is as follows.

If the `participantContextId` is not known, perform these steps to obtain it:

- query the participant profile using the TenantManager API
- record participant `participantProfileId`, its `tenantId` and the `participantContextId`. The latter is how we
  establish a correlation between CFM and dataspace components such as IdentityHub and ControlPlane.

After that, use the `participantContextId` to perform the following steps:

- get the client secret from Vault. We need this to authenticate REST calls against IdentityHub
- query all available KeyPairs owned by the `participantContextId`, select the (first) active one (`state=200`) and
  record the ID of the key pair.
- call IdentityHub's `/keypairs/rotate` endpoint with the information provided. In that call, please provide in the body
  a `keyId` and a `privateKeyAlias`. The `keyId` should be the participant's identifier (web:DID) plus the `"#"` sign,
  followed by a random string:
  ```json
  {
    "keyGeneratorParams": {
      "algorithm": "eddsa",
      "curve": "ed25519"    
     },
    "keyId": "{{participantIdentifier}}#{{$randomUUID}}",
    "privateKeyAlias": "{{$randomUUID}}" 
  }
  ```
- verify the correct execution of the rotation, either by checking the participant context's DID document and see if the
  new key is there, or call the Query-Keypair API again

Programmatically, this sequence is demonstrated in an E2E test in
[KeyRotationEndToEndTest.java](./tests/end2end/src/test/java/org/eclipse/edc/jad/tests/KeyRotationEndToEndTest.java).

The REST calls are demonstrated in the "Rotate Participant Key" folder in
the [Bruno collection](./requests/EDC-V%20Onboarding/Rotate%20Participant%20Key).

### Deploying JAD on a bare-metal/cloud-hosted Kubernetes

KinD is geared towards local development and testing. For example, it comes with a bunch of useful defaults, such as
storage classes, load balancers, network plugins, etc. If you want to deploy JAD on a bare-metal or cloud-hosted
Kubernetes cluster, then there are some caveats to keep in mind.

#### Configure network access and DNS

EDC-V, Keycloak and Vault will need to be accessible from outside the cluster. For this, your cluster needs a network
plugin and an external load balancer. For bare-metal installations, consider using [MetalLB](https://metallb.io).

In addition, you'll likely want DNS resolution for your cluster so that individual services can be reached via
subdomains, e.g. `http://auth.yourdomain.com/`, `http://vault.yourdomain.com/`, `controlplane.yourdomain.com` etc.
This must be configured with your DNS provider, and the specifics will vary greatly from one to the next. All entries
should point to the IP address of the Kubernetes host, for example:

![img.png](docs/images/dns.png)

Each [component](#components) of JAD has its own HTTP route (Kubernetes replacement for Ingress routes), so it may be
advisable to define DNS subdomains for each of them, for example:

- Control plane: `https://cp.yourdomain.com/` -> 194.123.456.88
- Identity Hub: `https://ih.yourdomain.com/` -> 194.123.456.88
- Keycloak: `https://auth.yourdomain.com/` -> 194.123.456.88
- Vault: `https://vault.yourdomain.com/` -> 194.123.456.88
- etc.

Where `194.178.218.88` is the IP address of the Kubernetes host running MetalLB (or similar).

_In actual production deployments, these individual hostnames, and potentially also individual IP addresses, would be
necessary to isolate security domains and prevent unauthorized access or privilege escalation._

#### Tune Traefik gateway controller

By default, Traefik binds to port 80 and 443 on the host machine. This is useful to enable clean URLs like
`http://tm.yourdomain.com/api/v1alpha1/cells` etc. without any ports. However, some Linux distributions don't allow
binding to well-defined ports to non-root users.

If that is the case (check Traefik's logs), adding the following snippet to `values.yaml` will fix the problem:

```yaml
hostNetwork: true
securityContext:
  capabilities:
    drop: [ ALL ]
    add: [ NET_BIND_SERVICE ]
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  runAsGroup: 0
  runAsNonRoot: false
  runAsUser: 0
```

#### Create Bruno Environment

Some of the URL paths used in Bruno are hard coded to `localhost` in a Bruno environment named `KinD Local`. This is
tailored to running JAD on a local KinD cluster. To make the collection usable for a remote deployment, we recommend
duplicating the collection and replace the `localhost` references with the DNS names of the services.

Create another environment to suit your setup:

![img.png](docs/images/bruno_custom_env.png)

#### Update deployment manifests

in [keycloak.yaml](k8s/base/keycloak.yaml) and [vault.yaml](k8s/base/vault.yaml), update the `hostnames` fields in the
`HTTPRoute` resources to match your DNS:

```yaml
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: edcv-gateway
      kind: Gateway
      sectionName: http
  hostnames:
    - keycloak.localhost
    - auth.yourdomain.com
```

Do this for all `HTTPRoute` declarations in all components' manifests. The `hostnames` field should contain entries
matching your DNS subdomains that you have also used to create the new Bruno environment.

#### Update the Keycloak realm

In `k8s/base/keycloak.yaml`, find the line that says:

```text
"bound_issuer": "http://vault.localhost/realms/edcv"
```

and replace with

```text
"bound_issuer": "http://vault.yourdomain.com/realms/edcv"
```

This is crucial for Vault authentication to work properly.

#### Tune readiness probes

We've set up the readiness probes fairly tight, to avoid long wait times on local KinD clusters. However, in some
Kubernetes
clusters, these may need to be tuned to allow for longer periods and/or larger failure thresholds. In particular,
KeyCloak takes a long time to start up, sometimes several minutes depending on the hardware.
If the thresholds are too tight, then Keycloak may get hung up in endless restart loops: Kubernetes kills the pod
before it reaches a healthy state.

To start, edit the `readinessProbe` section of the `keycloak` deployment manifest:

```yaml
# keycloak.yaml
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health/ready
    port: 9000
  initialDelaySeconds: 30 # changed
  periodSeconds: 10 # changed
  successThreshold: 1
  failureThreshold: 15 # changed
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health/live
    port: 9000
  initialDelaySeconds: 30 # changed
  periodSeconds: 10 # changed
  successThreshold: 1
  failureThreshold: 15 # changed
```

## Using the OpenAPI specifications

We've included [OpenAPI specifications](./openapi) for all JAD components that expose REST APIs. We'll call those APIs
"Administration APIs" and you can read more about them in
the [EDC-V documentation](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Virtual-Connector/blob/main/docs/administration_api.md).

Please note, that we've taken the liberty of curating the list of APIs to what we consider to be the most relevant for
the end-user. We have also prioritized deployment resilience, ensuring that it is difficult for users to accidentally
misconfigure their JAD deployment to the point of failure.

However, the complete specifications for each component, including modifying and thus potentially dangerous actions, can
be found in the respective GitHub repositories.

### Intended audience

The curated OpenAPI specifications are intended for developers who have graduated beyond the use of
the [Bruno collection](./requests/EDC-V%20Onboarding) and want to integrate JAD components into their own applications
such as ERP systems, web UIs or other applications.

Another important use case is to generate server stubs for client applications to make testing independent of the JAD
deployment, and thus easier and more repeatable.

### Swagger UI vs generated clients

Unfortunately, Keycloak rejects authorization requests from Swagger UI due to CORS restrictions. Therefore, we recommend
using these OpenAPI files to manually implement or generate client libraries for your programming language of choice.
One popular possibility to do that is
the [OpenAPI Generator project](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).

The generator can be run in an ephemeral Docker container (amongst _many_ other options) to generate client stubs for
various languages. Below are some examples of how to use it, myriads more are available on the project's GitHub page.

**Example 1: generate a Java client using OkHttp and Gson**:

```shell
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}/openapi:/local" openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \
    -i /local/identity-api.yaml \
    -g java \
    --library okhttp-gson \
    -o /local/out/java
```

**Example 2: generate a TypeScript client using Angular**:

```shell
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}/openapi:/local" openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \
    -i /local/identity-api.yaml \
    -g typescript-angular \
    -o /local/out/ts
```

**Example 3: generate a Go client**:

```shell
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}/openapi:/local" openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \
    -i /local/identity-api.yaml \
    -g go \
    -o /local/out/go
```

Client code generators typically don't hard-wire authentication and authorization logic into the generated client code,
so you'll need to add it manually. This is expected, and the generated code often contains examples of how to do it.
Please consult the generators' documentation for more information.

Please be aware that as with all generated code, the generated client stubs should be seen as a starting point, and
adjustments and tweaks are almost certainly necessary to make it work in your application.

The JAD project does not provide any official support for client libraries, nor are we responsible for any issues that
may arise from using them, nor do we officially endorse any particular client library or generator thereof.
